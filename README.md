# data_visualization_task3.py
"This project focuses on Data Visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. It transforms raw data into meaningful visual insights through charts, graphs, and a correlation heatmap. The visualizations help in understanding data trends, comparisons, and relationships for better decision-making."
Data Visualization - CodeAlpha Internship Task 3
 Project Overview

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.
The goal of this task is to transform raw data into visual formats like charts, graphs, and dashboards using Python visualization libraries.
Data visualization helps in understanding patterns, trends, and insights effectively.

 Task Requirements

Convert raw data into meaningful visual representations.
Use visualization libraries like:
Matplotlib
Seaborn
(Optional) Tableau or other tools
Create compelling data stories to support decision-making.


 Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x
Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib (for basic charts)
Seaborn (for advanced visualizations)

 Files in this Repository
data_visualization_task3.py → Main Python script for visualizations
README.md → Project documentation


 Visualizations Included
Bar Chart (Category-wise comparison)
Line Chart (Trend analysis)
Pie Chart (Percentage distribution)
Heatmap (Correlation visualization)


 How to Run the Code

Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>


Navigate to the project folder:
cd data-visualization-task3


Install dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
